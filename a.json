The Data Link layer also ensures data is transferred to the correct device within a LAN and is divided into two sublayers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC). The LLC sublayer connects to the Network layer (Layer 3), managing protocol identification and error correction, while the MAC sublayer interfaces with the Physical layer (Layer 1), handling addressing and access to the physical medium.",

Routing involves determining the best physical path for data to travel based on factors such as network conditions, configured routes, and priority of service. Packet forwarding refers to the actual transfer of packets between devices based on routing decisions, ensuring data moves through the network toward its destination. \n\nLogical addressing (e.g., IP) is derived from information received from adjacent layers. During encapsulation, it relies on transport layer (Layer 4) headers, assigning a source and destination IP address to the packet. During decapsulation, it extracts these logical addresses from the packet headers, often relying on ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map IP addresses to MAC addresses for the next hop in the transmission.\n\nAdditionally, the Network layer facilitates diagnostic and error-reporting functionalities using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), which identifies issues like unreachable hosts or networks. Routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), are employed to dynamically manage and update routing tables, ensuring efficient data delivery across networks.",

It segments data from the upper layers into smaller units (segments) for efficient transmission and reassembles them at the destination. The layer provides reliability using protocols like Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP ensures a connection-oriented, reliable communication with error recovery and retransmission, while UDP offers connectionless, faster transmission but without guaranteed delivery.

The `gateway4` address must be reachable from the interface's IP subnet. Double-check the gateway and IP configuration.\n\n- **\"Multiple default routes detected\":**\n  *What it means:* Could be a real issue if conflicting routes exist. However, in advanced setups, this might be intentional and require additional routing rules.\n\n- **\"Cannot reach gateway\":**\n  *What it means:* A cautionary warning. This may occur if the gateway is temporarily unreachable (e.g., disconnected network cable), even though the issue may resolve when the network reconnects.\n\n**Important Note:** Netplan warnings are often cautious and may not always indicate real problems. Always double-check intentional configurations (e.g., multiple gateways) to ensure they work as expected.",
