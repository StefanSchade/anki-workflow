      "answer": "A LAN (Local Area Network) is a group of interconnected devices located in a single physical location. Its range can vary from small (e.g., a private residence) to large (e.g., an enterprise campus), but it is limited by its physical boundaries."

      "type": "basic",
      "question": "What warnings can Netplan generate for a `gateway` configuration, and do they always indicate real problems?",
      "answer": "Possible warnings:\n- **\"Gateway not on the same subnet as the interface IP\":**\n  *What it means:* Usually a real problem. The `gateway4` address must be reachable from the interface's IP subnet. Double-check the gateway and IP configuration.\n\n- **\"Multiple default routes detected\":**\n  *What it means:* Could be a real issue if conflicting routes exist. However, in advanced setups, this might be intentional and require additional routing rules.\n\n- **\"Cannot reach gateway\":**\n  *What it means:* A cautionary warning. This may occur if the gateway is temporarily unreachable (e.g., disconnected network cable), even though the issue may resolve when the network reconnects.\n\n**Important Note:** Netplan warnings are often cautious and may not always indicate real problems. Always double-check intentional configurations (e.g., multiple gateways) to ensure they work as expected.",
